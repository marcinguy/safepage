Dear Site Owner,

This is a genuine alert to let you know your website has been hacked. We are a legitimate cyber security business and as part of our service checking for new threats we find legitimate websites that have been hacked, like yours. We believe it is out duty to inform the website owners immediately, that's why we are writing to you now.

Unfortunately your website shows up in Google search results as a malicious website that has been compromised by hackers. Also, as it ranks so highly in Google as a compromised site, it's likely this has been going on for months rather than days or weeks.

We strongly suggest you confirm this situation.

You can scan your website for FREE (yes, free) with multiple scanners at https://www.unifysec.com

We do this in order to improve security on the Internet and to help people get their website secure. If a consulting service is needed, we are free to help. That is how we make our money.

We will continue to inform you daily about your website status until the issue is resolved. Wish you good luck!

Best Regards,
Unifysec Team
